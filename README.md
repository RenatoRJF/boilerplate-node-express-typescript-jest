## Boilerplace Node, Express, Typescript and Jest
This is a simple boilerplate for starting a new API project with a simple structure.

#### Basic configuration
With this setup you have following already configured:

* `typescript`: when you start the app, a 'build' folder is created with all your js files transpiled.
* `Jest`: all configuration related to test are done to be used and you can update it according your need.
* `nodemon`: you need to start the server only once and it will be reload each time you save changes.
* `.editorconfig`: you can set up a this file to format your code each time you write it.

#### Running the project
After clone the project, go into the project directory and run to following commands:

```
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Start the server with live reload
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with watch
npm run test:watch
```
